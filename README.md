This GitHub repository showcases a basic data analysis project using the Python pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries.

I've utilized the data.csv file to demonstrate the capabilities of pandas libraries for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. 
This Notebook contains the code examples used for these operations, including numpy's array manipulation and mathematical functions, as well as matplotlib's plotting and visualization tools. If you're looking to understand how pandas, numpy, and matplotlib can be used  for various data analysis tasks, this repository can serve as a useful reference.
